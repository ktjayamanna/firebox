OG: Now we are going to add an endpoint called sync where clients can poll every two seconds if the remote has changed! The way you evaluate that is that sync pollendpoint requires last sync time from the system table in sql lite. then the sync can compare that with the chunk table in dynamodb to identify what chunks have been created after the client's last sync. If no chunks are new just send up to date signal to client and client do nothing. If there are chunks, then sync end point should return file_id, file_path, chunk ids of that file, and finger prints of all the chunks. Client then, check if the file_path of the updated file on remote exists in the local db (remember that file id won't catch this, only file path will). If it exists, the query for the existing chunks of this file and then compare which chunks are out dated. Then, use the download request DownloadRequest to get the presigned urls for the new chunks, download them, and then reo the chunking process you already do when a file is added to the sync folder. Only difference this time is that you do not chunk the file. Instead you download new chunks from the remote, and then reuse the ones that have not changed, and use them all to reconstruct the file. You have to update the local db and sync status just like you would do when you add a file to the sync folder.This process is delta syncing so that clients do not have to download the entire file again. Since the upload file mechanism is tested to be working follow that implementation as much you can; there are subtle differences because this tiem you are not chunking the file, but rather downloading the chunks and then using them to reconstruct the file.Notice that,this prceess is a polling that happens every two mins by each device (client). Use the same ids on local devices as well as remote. But do not rely on it. Instead use fingerprint to recognize the chunks and file path for files and flders.
