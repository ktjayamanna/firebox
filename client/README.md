# Dropbox Client

This is the client component of the Dropbox-like system. It provides a local synchronization service with the following features:

- File synchronization using inotify for real-time change detection
- File chunking (5MB chunks) for efficient synchronization
- SQLite database for storing file metadata and chunk information
- FastAPI server for API access

## Database Models

### FilesMetaData
- file_id: Primary key, unique identifier for the file
- folder_id: Identifier for the parent folder
- file_type: Type of the file

### Chunks
- chunk_id: Primary key, unique identifier for the chunk
- file_id: Foreign key to FilesMetaData
- created_at: Timestamp when the chunk was created
- last_synced: Timestamp when the chunk was last synchronized
- fingerprint: Hash of the chunk data for integrity verification

## Running the Client

The client is designed to run in a Docker container. Use the provided Docker Compose file to start the client:

```bash
cd deployment/docker
docker-compose up -d
```

This will start the client container with the FastAPI server running on port 8000.

## Testing the Client

The client includes a comprehensive test suite to verify its functionality:

### Smoke Tests

The smoke tests are located in the `client/tests/smoke` directory and can be run individually or all at once:

```bash
# Run all smoke tests
./client/tests/smoke/run_all_tests.sh

# Run specific tests
./client/tests/smoke/test_file_sync.sh
./client/tests/smoke/test_file_modifications.sh
./client/tests/smoke/test_folder_operations.sh
./client/tests/smoke/test_api_endpoints.sh
```

The test suite includes:

1. **File Synchronization Test** (`test_file_sync.sh`)
   - Tests basic file upload and synchronization
   - Verifies files are properly tracked in the database
   - Checks folder creation and tracking

2. **File Modifications Test** (`test_file_modifications.sh`)
   - Tests file content modification detection
   - Verifies hash changes are detected and recorded
   - Checks chunk recreation on file modification

3. **Folder Operations Test** (`test_folder_operations.sh`)
   - Tests nested folder structure creation
   - Verifies parent-child folder relationships
   - Checks file creation in nested folders

4. **API Endpoints Test** (`test_api_endpoints.sh`)
   - Tests all API endpoints for proper functionality
   - Verifies file and folder metadata retrieval
   - Checks system health endpoints

For more information about the test suite, see [client/tests/README.md](tests/README.md).
