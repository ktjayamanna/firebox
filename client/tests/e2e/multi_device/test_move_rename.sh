# Firebox Client Multi-Device Test Move and Rename Operations
#===================================================================================
# Description: This script tests the move and rename functionality across multiple
# client devices:
# - Support for moving files between directories
# - Handling of file and folder renames
# - Preservation of chunk data during moves
#
# The script follows these steps:
# 1. Create: Creates test folders and files on both clients
# 2. Verify: Confirms the folders and files are processed correctly
# 3. Move: Moves files between folders on both clients
# 4. Rename: Renames files and folders on both clients
# 5. Verify: Confirms database records are updated correctly
#===================================================================================
