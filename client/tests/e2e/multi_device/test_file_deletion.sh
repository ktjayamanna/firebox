# Firebox Client Multi-Device Test File Deletion
#===================================================================================
# Description: This script tests the file deletion functionality across multiple
# client devices:
# - Detection of file deletion
# - Removal of file metadata from the database
# - Cleanup of associated chunks
#
# The script follows these steps:
# 1. Create: Creates test files and uploads them to each client's sync directory
# 2. Verify: Confirms the files are processed and stored in the database
# 3. Delete: Removes the files from each client's sync directory
# 4. Verify: Confirms the files are removed from the database and chunks are cleaned up
