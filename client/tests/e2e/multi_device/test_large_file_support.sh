# Firebox Client Multi-Device Test Large File Support
#===================================================================================
# Description: This script tests the large file support functionality across multiple
# client devices:
# - Handling of files larger than the chunk size
# - Proper chunking and reassembly
# - Downloading specific chunks
#
# The script follows these steps:
# 1. Create: Creates a large file (20MB) on both clients
# 2. Verify: Confirms the file is processed and chunks are created
# 3. Download: Tests downloading specific chunks
