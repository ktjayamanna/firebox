# Firebox Client Test Move and Rename Operations
#===================================================================================
# Description: This script tests the move and rename functionality:
# - Support for moving files between directories
# - Handling of file and folder renames
# - Preservation of chunk data during moves
#
# The script follows these steps:
# 1. Create: Creates test files and folders
# 2. Upload: Copies them to the sync directory
# 3. Move: Moves files between folders
# 4. Rename: Renames files and folders
# 5. Verify: Confirms database records are updated correctly
